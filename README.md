# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis of two Kickstart projects and comparing them based on launch date and goal.
### Purpose
Purpose of this project is to implement the different methods of analysis learned in "Module One" and analyze the raw "Kickstarting" data.
## Analysis and Challenges
To find the trends in "Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date" and additional, columns, graphs, and tables were created to create the chart/graph that would give us a better visualization of the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first analysis of the launch date is that from the years 2009-2017 the most effective months to launch theater are in May and June.
The second analysis of the launch date is that from the years 2009-2017 the month of Decemeber has almost the same amount of successful and failed campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Analysis based on outcomes of goals are goals less than 1000 have the lowest failure rate and goals from 1000>=4999 had the most pledges and came in second for the lowest failure rate. People are more likely to pledge between 1000>=4999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A challenge that I encountered was using the "countif" formula. The difficulty was trying to use the "countif" formula to sort the coulumns, in addition to counting the number of goals. It was easier to use the "countif" formula to sort through the columns, which resulted in me not having to sort and copy the successful, failed, and canceled data into a new worksheet. If you do not create a new worksheet to sort data, it is less likely to have to create a zip file, because the original file is too large.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Two conclusions that can be deduced about the Outcomes based on the Launch Date are that May and June are the best months to launch a theater campaign. The second conclusion is that, it is highly unliked for a theater campaign to be canceled.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The conclusion from Outcomes based on Goals, is that a goal of less than $1000 is more likely to be successful and has a low cancellation rate.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

A limitation of the data set is we cannot compare the months to the number successful in the two data sets. We know the number successful but we don't know which months were successful and what their goal amount was.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Another graph we could have used was a bar chart for Theater Outcomes by Lauch date, so we could have grouped them together to see the exact amounts and compare the categories failed, successful, and canceled side-by-side. Another table we could have used was the quartile to see which plays fell in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, quartile and located any outliers. Then we could utilize the box and whisper chart to visualize the outliers.
